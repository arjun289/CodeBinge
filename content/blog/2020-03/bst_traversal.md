Tree traverals are required when we need to visit every single node in a tree.

There are three ways of traversal:
1. In-order traversal
2. Pre-order traversal
3. Post-order traversal

### In-order traversal

Steps
1. visit the left subtree.
2. visit the parent.
3. visit the right subtree

In order traversal leads to sorted output in the ascending order.


### Pre-order traversal

Steps
1. visit the root.
2. visit the left subtree.
3. visit the right subtree.

### Post-order traversal


Steps
1. visit the left subtree.
2. visit the right subtree.
3. visit the root.
