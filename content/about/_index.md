##### Why CodeBinge?
I fell in love with programming in my under graduation. I felt like it gave 
me superpowers to create whatever I could, and I started **codebinging** 
(if that's a word). I believe a lot in **self learning**. When we self-learn 
the best way to retain, the plethora of concepts we come across is through 
**sharing and teaching**, and I came up with this blog to share whatever I learnt, 
with the world.

##### Present Status
I am a **backend developer** and I focus on:

- Architecting applications.
- Programming them in languages such as:
  - Elixir (Favourite)
  - Python
  - Javascript
- Contributing to [open source](https://github.com/arjun289/)
- DevOps
